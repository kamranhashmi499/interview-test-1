### Test 1: Create shopify trial store and customize it.

1. Create a Shopify trial store.

2. Clone this repository and create new branch including your name.

    eg: johndoe-branch

3. Upload the theme file to the Shopify store.

4. Programming task

    a. Task 1: Modify the theme as below:

        i. On all the pages/templates except the homepage, it becomes a sticky header bar. When you scroll down, the header with the background colour is fixed at the top.

            [Demo video]:

        ii. Once the homepage is loaded, the header bar with transparent background overlays the content when the first section is a slideshow or full-width image section. This only applies to the homepage, not to other pages/templates. When you scroll down, it is a sticky header bar with the background colour.

            Demo video:
            ```

            ```

    b. Task 2: Modify the theme such that the sticky header bar works well when the announcement bar option is enabled.

        Demo video:
        ```
